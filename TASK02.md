# PRODIGY_DS_02
# Titanic Survival Prediction Project
Perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset the Titanic dataset from Kaggle.
Explore the relationships between variables and identify patterns and trends in the data.
This project uses the Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival. 
# Libraries Used
pandas </br>
numpy</br>
matplotlib</br>
seaborn
# Dataset
The dataset is obtained from Kaggle and contains information about passengers on the Titanic, including their age, sex, class, fare, and whether they survived.

# Data Preprocessing
The following steps are taken for data preprocessing:

Load the dataset
Handle missing values
Age: Fill missing values with the median age
Embarked: Fill missing values with the most common embarkation point
Cabin: Drop the column as it has too many missing values
Create new features
FamilySize: Total number of family members on board
AgeGroup: Age group of the passenger

# Exploratory Data Analysis
The following relationships between variables are explored:

***Age vs Fare*** </br>
***Passenger class vs Survival***  </br>
***Passenger class vs Fare***  </br>
***Age group vs Survival***  </br>
***Age group vs Fare***

# Conclusion
After performing data cleaning and exploratory data analysis on the Titanic dataset, we can observe the following patterns and trends:

Passengers in higher classes had a higher survival rate. </br>
Passengers who paid a higher fare had a higher survival rate. </br>
Passengers who were younger had a higher survival rate. </br>
Passengers who were in a larger family size had a lower survival rate. </br>
Passengers who were in the 'Child' age group had the highest survival rate. </br>
Passengers who were in the 'Senior' age group had the lowest survival rate. </br>
Passengers who paid a higher fare were more likely to be in a higher class. </br>
Passengers who were in a larger family size were more likely to be in a lower class. </br>
Passengers who were in the 'Child' age group were more likely to be in a higher class. </br>
Passengers who were in the 'Senior' age group were more likely to be in a lower class. </br>
These observations can be used to build a predictive model for passenger survival on the Titanic. </br>
